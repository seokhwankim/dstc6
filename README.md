# Dialog System Technology Challenge 6 (DSTC6)

Starting as an initiative to provide a common testbed for the task of Dialogue State Tracking, the first Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) was organized in 2013, followed by Dialog State Tracking Challenges 2 & 3 in 2014. More recently, Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 and Dialog State Tracking Challenge 5 have been completed in 2015 and 2016. While the first three challenges focused on human-computer interactions, the last two did it on human-human interactions, also offering pilot tasks on Spoken Language Understanding, Speech Act Prediction, Natural Language Generation and End-to-end System Evaluation.

Given the remarkable success of the first five editions of the DSTC, and understanding both, the complexity of the dialogue phenomenon and the interest of the research community in a wider variety of dialogue related problems, the DSTC rebrands itself as "Dialogue System Technology Challenges" for its sixth edition. In this sixth edition of the DSTC, a call for task proposals has been issued with the objective of inviting interested organizations to propose, organize and conduct dialogue related challenges in specific areas of research and under the umbrella of the DSTC.
